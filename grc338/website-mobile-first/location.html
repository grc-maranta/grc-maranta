            <h2>Location</h2>
            <p>SLO Coffee Co. at 1130 Garden Street is our beloved first location and is in the heart of downtown San Luis Obispo.</p>
            <p>As with most downtowns, parking can be limited on Garden Street, but you'll find metered street parking on all surrounding streets, and there's a parking garage located to the right off Marsh Street, just after passing Chorro Street and Founders Bank. This parking garage offers free parking for the first hour and is very reasonable beyond that. We also have bike parking available right on Garden Street a few steps from our front door.</p>
