            <h2>About</h2>
                <p>We are Jon & Sara Peterson, owners of SLO Coffee Co. We spent over 10 years dreaming, planning, learning and working in all things coffee with the hope that someday we would start a shop of our own. In July of 2017, we launched SLO Coffee Co. on Garden Street in Downtown San Luis Obispo. A year later, we rolled up the doors to our roasting company, HoneyCo Coffee Roasters. We now have over 40 wonderful employees, and love that you have made SLO Coffee Co. one of the most sought after destinations on the Central Coast.</p>
                <p>Thank you so much to all of you who have made this possible. Our goal has always been to create inspiring spaces, with great people and amazing products, in a way that truly adds value to the community around us. We hope you love it here.</p>
                <p>Please contact us at 805.456.9898 or at slocoffee@gmail.com.</p>
